This application is generated using [LoopBack 4 CLI](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Command-line-interface.html) with the
[initial project layout](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Loopback-application-layout.html).

## Install dependencies

By default, dependencies were installed when this application was generated.
Whenever dependencies in `package.json` are changed, run the following command:

```sh
npm install
```

To only install resolved dependencies in `package-lock.json`:

```sh
npm ci
```

## Run the application

```sh
npm start
```

You can also run `node .` to skip the build step.

Open http://127.0.0.1:3000 in your browser.

## Rebuild the project

To incrementally build the project:

```sh
npm run build
```

To force a full build by cleaning up cached artifacts:

npm run clean
npm run build
```

## Fix code style and formatting issues

If `eslint` and `prettier` are enabled for this project, you can use the
following commands to check code style and formatting issues.

```sh
npm run lint
```

To automatically fix such issues:

```sh
npm run lint:fix
```

## Other useful commands

- `npm run migrate`: Migrate database schemas for models

## Set of commands used

To initialize the workspace we need to work with:

```
lb4 note
```

To build the model - This step consists of building the schema of our database [essentially the columns of our database]

```
lb4 model
```

To create a datasource - We choose an in-memory database

```
lb4 datasource
```

To create/generate a repository for 'note'

```
lb4 repository
```

To initialize a controller - this will decide whether we use a REST controller with CRUD functions or something of our own

```
lb4 controller
```
